### 3. **Database Migration**

Created `add-company-address-fields.sql` to add the following columns to the `leads` table:

- `company_city` (TEXT)
- `company_state` (TEXT)
- `company_zip` (TEXT)

## How It Works

### Company Address

1. User starts typing in the "Address" field
2. Google Places API provides autocomplete suggestions
3. When user selects an address:
   - **Address** field is populated with street address
   - **City** field is auto-filled
   - **State** field is auto-filled (2-letter code)
   - **Zip Code** field is auto-filled
4. User can manually edit any field if needed

### Project Addresses

Same functionality as company address, but for each project in the "Potential Projects" section.

## Required Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration

Execute the SQL migration in Supabase:

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
rbc-field-management/add-company-address-fields.sql
```

### 2. Set Google API Key

The Google API key should already be configured in your environment. If not, add it to `.env.local`:

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Note:** The `.env.local` file is in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to version control.

### 3. Verify Google APIs are Enabled

Make sure these APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud Console:

- ✅ Places API
- ✅ Maps JavaScript API
- ✅ Geocoding API

## Testing

1. Navigate to **Leads** → **Add Lead**
2. In the "Company Information" section:

   - Click on the "Address" field
   - Start typing an address (e.g., "149 Skillman")
   - Select an address from the dropdown
   - Verify that City, State, and Zip are auto-filled

3. In the "Potential Projects" section:

   - Click "Add Project"
   - Click on the "Address" field
   - Start typing an address
   - Select an address from the dropdown
   - Verify that City, State, and Zip are auto-filled

4. Test editing a lead:
   - Navigate to an existing lead
   - Click "Edit"
   - Verify that all address fields are populated correctly
   - Try updating the address using autocomplete
   - Save and verify the changes persist

## Features

## Database Schema

### Leads Table (Updated)

```sql
leads (
  ...existing columns...,
  company_address TEXT,
  company_city TEXT,      -- NEW
  company_state TEXT,     -- NEW
  company_zip TEXT,       -- NEW
  ...other columns...
)
```

### Projects (Stored in JSONB)

Each project in the `projects` JSONB array now includes:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_id",
  "type": "Apartment Complex",
  "address": "149 Skillman Street",
  "city": "Brooklyn",
  "state": "NY",
  "zip": "11205",
  "unit_count": "50",
  "work_type": "maintenance_id",
  "notes": "Notes here"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Run the database migration** (add-company-address-fields.sql)
2. ✅ **Test the functionality** in both Create and Edit pages
3. ✅ **Verify data is being saved** correctly in Supabase
4. Consider adding address autocomplete to other parts of the app:
   - Customer creation
   - Property creation
   - Job creation

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that the Google API key is set correctly
2. Verify that the required APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Check the browser console for any error messages
4. Verify that the database migration was run successfully
